<h1>Intro to Splunk Observability</h1>
<h3>Monitoring and Observability</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> - analyse and understand the data about the health and performance of your system</li>
<li>Observability - quality of software services, platforms, and products that allow you to understand how systems are behaving. Makes investigating and disagnosing problems easier.</li>
<li><strong>Why Use Observability?</strong> User experience, Improve incident response, KPIs and other business metrics, improve engineer agility</li>
<li>"Keeping an eye on things"</li>
<li>Problems are identified based on expected behavior of factors</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Characteristics of an Observable System</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Data Collection</li>
<li>Data visualization</li>
<li>Problem Detection</li>
<li>Data Exploration and Correlation</li>
<li>Remediation</li>
</ol></p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Tool Sprawl - Time spent procuring multiple tools</li>
<li>Missing Data - sampling and non-granular</li>
<li>Scale - degradation and long delays in cloud environments</li>
<li>Slow Alerts</li>
<li>Limited Analytics - data from multiple tools</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Getting Data In</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>You can send data to Splunk O11Y using the Open Telementry Collector to connect to cloud services such as AWS, GCP or Azure.</li>
<li>You can send business related metrics from your apps such as the # of API calls or number of logins</li>
<li>You must be an admin to configure some of the integrations</li>
<li>Select the Navigation menu > Data Management. Click New Integration. Follow the steps in the wizard</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Splunk Observability Cloud</h3>
<p>Splunk O11y provides a seamless workflow for your DevOps teams and developers to easily monitor, troubleshoot and investigate issues with your infrastructure, apps and services.</p>
<p>Start from Splunk RUM(frontend traces) to Splunk APM(backend traces)</p>

<h3>Splunk IM</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Provides a simple and comprehensive platform to monitor and troubleshoot your infrastructure and apps</li>
<li>Built-In Content</li>
<li>Custom Dashboards</li>
<li>Detectors for Alerting</li>
<li></li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Splunk APM</h3>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Monitors cloud-native, microservices-based apps by collecting traces. A <strong>trace</strong> is a collection of actions (known as spans) that occur to complete a transaction. Splunk APM collects and analyzes every span and trace that is generated by the instrumentation</li>
<li>APM overview page tells you which services or business flows have the highest error rate</li>
<li>Explore further on this page. See a service map of all services</li>
<li>Tag Spotlight - analyze performance of your services to discover trends</li>
<li>Traces shows you a list of exemplar traces, click on any trace to see details</li>
<li>AlwaysOn Profiling collects stack traces so that you can discover lines in code that are slowing down or crashing systems to reduce MTTR</li>
<li>Memory profiling adds memory allocation data to stack traces and exposes JVM memory metrics. Discover leaks and unusual consumption patterns</li>
<li></li>
</ul></p>

<h3>Splunk Log Observer</h3>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Perform code-less queries on your logs to find the source of your problems</li>
<li>Timeline - gives you a quick overview of the health of your system. Drill down on particular severity by clicking the desired severity and adding it to the filter</li>
<li>Logs Table - Displays logs as they are streaming in the most recent logs appearing at the top. Filters applied to the Timeline, are also applied to the logs in the log table</li>
<li>Live Tail - Observe changes in your system in real time. Provides near real time view of your logs as they stream into Log Observer</li>
</ul></p>


<h3>Splunk Real User Monitoring (RUM)</h3>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Monitors the performance and health of the front-end UX. </li>
<li>Collects metrics, web vitals, errors and other forms of data</li>
<li>To monitor only browser traces from your app, install Splunk RUM. To montior you app from browser to back-end, use Splunk RUM with Splunk APM</li>
</ul></p>


<h3>Splunk Syntheric Monitoring</h3>
<ul>
<p>
<li>Visibility into your UX.</li>
<li>Run tests in pre-production environments to run performance tests during the software development process, fix any issues with content before they impact real users on your production website</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul></p>
